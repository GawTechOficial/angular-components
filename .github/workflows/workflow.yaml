# Continuous Integration workflow
#
# This workflow runs on pull requests to ensure that the code adheres to the branch policies and builds successfully.
# - Only allows PRs to main from release/* or hotfix/*
# - Only allows PRs to develop from main, feature/*, or fix/*
# - Installs dependencies, sets up Node.js, installs Angular CLI, and builds the project.
